         <b>This palace is a five-story pyramidal</b>  shaped monument that rises to
        about 50 feet (15 m). The top three floors of the structure have the
        width of a single room, while the first and second floors have patios in
        front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the street, is like a
        honeycomb with small portholes. Each porthole has miniature windows and
        carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a
        mass of semi-octagonal bays, giving the monument its unique façade. The
        inner face on the back side of the building consists of chambers built
        with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation, and reach up to
        the top floor. The interior of the palace has been described as "having
        rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or
        gilding; while fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard".[8][9] Lal
        Chand Ustad was the architect. Built-in red and pink coloured sandstone,
        in keeping with the décor of the other monuments in the city, its colour
        is a full testimony to the epithet of "Pink City" given to Jaipur. Its
        façade with 953 niches with intricately carved jharokhas (some are made
        of wood) is a stark contrast to the plain-looking rear side of the
        structure. Its cultural and architectural heritage is a reflection of a
        fusion of Hindu Rajput architecture and Islamic Mughal architecture; the
        Rajput style is seen in the form of domed canopies, fluted pillars,
        lotus, and floral patterns, and the Islamic style as evident in its
        stone inlay filigree work and arches (as distinguished from its
        similarity with the Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri).[10] The entry to the
        Hawa Mahal from the city palace side is through an imperial door. It
        opens into a large courtyard, which has double-storeyed buildings on
        three sides, with the Hawa Mahal enclosing it on the east side. An
        archaeological museum is also housed in this courtyard.[11] Hawa Mahal
        was also known as the chef-d'œuvre of Maharaja Jai Singh as it was his
        favourite resort because of the elegance and built-in interior of the
        Mahal. The cooling effect in the chambers, provided by the breeze
        passing through the small windows of the façade, was enhanced by the
        fountains provided at the centre of each of the chambers.[12] The top
        two floors of the Hawa Mahal are accessed only through ramps. The Mahal
        is maintained by the archaeological department of the Government of
        Rajasthan.[11]
