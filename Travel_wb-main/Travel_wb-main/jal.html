        The Jal Mahal Palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of
        architecture (common in Rajasthan) on a grand scale. The building has a
        picturesque view of Man Sagar Lake, but owing to its seclusion from land
        is equally the focus of a viewpoint from the Man Sagar Dam on the
        eastern side of the lake in front of the backdrop of the surrounding
        Nahargarh ("tiger-abode") hills. The palace, built with local sandstone,
        is a three-storied building, with the third floor only existing on the
        eastern side of the palace. The eastern side is not visible from the
        road side public promenade, which is the Western side of the palace. The
        additional lower levels of the eastern side remain underwater when the
        lake is full. The Jal Mahal has a terrace floor with a garden, and the
        garden has four Tibaris facing north, south, east and west. The Tibaris
        are designed in the Bengal roof style architecture while the four
        octagonal Chhatri on the roof mark the corners of the monument. The
        palace had suffered subsidence in the past and also partial seepage
        (plaster work and wall damage equivalent to rising damp) because of
        water logging, which have been repaired under a restoration project of
        the Government of Rajasthan.[1] The hills surrounding the lake area,
        towards the north east of Jaipur, have quartzite rock formations (with a
        thin layer of soil cover), which is part of the Aravalli hills range.
        Rock exposures on the surface in some parts of the project area have
        also been used for constructing buildings. From the northeast, the Kanak
        Vrindavan valley, where a temple complex sits, the hills slope gently
        towards the lake edge. Within the lake area, the ground area is made up
        of a thick mantle of soil, blown sand, and alluvium. Forest denudation,
        particularly in the hilly areas, has caused soil erosion, compounded by
        wind and water action. As a result, silt built up in the lake
        incrementally raises the lake bed.[2] On the terrace of the palace, a
        garden was built with arched passages. At each corner of this palace
        semi-octagonal towers were built with an elegant cupola.[3]
