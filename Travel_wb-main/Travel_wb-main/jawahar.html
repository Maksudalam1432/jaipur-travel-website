        The diameter of the circle is 452 m (1,483 ft) and the circumference measures 1,420 m (4,660 ft). This park was fully developed by JDA (Jaipur Development Authority), and is one of Jaipur's popular leisure destinations. There are multiple concentric tracks in the park. It is surrounded by Rose Gardens.
